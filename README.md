# Roland SC-55 soundfont
A carefully crafted, somewhat accurate soundfont imitating the legendary Roland SC-55 synthesizer. While the overall sound quality may be a tad unimpressive (most of the samples were taken from the Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth, actually), the soundfont is very lightweight—just over 7 MB!

The Roland SC-55 is the sound module that's basically a millennial's childhood nostalgia. It was released all the way back in 1991, and it's still celebrated to this day. The synthesizer served as a successor to the Roland MT-32, which was notorious for not meeting any MIDI standard (it came to being years before General MIDI happened), and was the intended "sound output thing" for playing back the soundtrack composed for Doom.

This particular soundfont was created out of the feeling that there's no perfect Roland SC-55 soundfont out there. Many soundfonts imitating the sound module of those I know about are imperfect: the sample mapping may be a bit inaccurate, some samples are completely different, and there can be several oversights. As a result, I was motivated to create a SC-55 soundfont of my own. However, it itself may not be perfect for some, but I'm satisfied with the result. Methinks it just sounds cool.

The soundfont is relatively accurate to the actual Roland SC-55, but due to most samples being derived from the GS Wavetable Synth (and a little artistic flavor...chef's kiss), there can still be slight differences from real hardware.

This soundfont currently doesn't have a SFX kit, but I'm planning to add it in a future update. Also worth mentioning is the support for the "wide" variants of certain instruments as defined in the Roland GS standard, though other GS melodic instruments aren't included in the soundfont (for the time being).
